CKEditor shopping cart plugin (Tested on CKEditor 4.4.3)

This plugin requires:
  CKEditor Widget Plugin (4.4.3) - to get this working you need to download it and download the CKEditor lineutils plugin, and add them to your plugins folder and config file.

Usage:
  Add the whole shoppingcart folder to your CKEditor plugins directory and CKEditor config file.

Info on how it works internally (if it needs to be changed):
  The actual CKEditor plugin and dialog is in plugin/plugin.js and dialog/
  The external javascript libraries used are in ./vendor
  The internal javascript cart libraries are in ./lib
  The handlebars templates (HTML) for the cart are in ./templates
  These are all then compiled into a plugin.js (for CKEditor users) and shoppingcartlib.js (for end users), by running the compile bash script.
  This was done so that the plugin could be added easily as is, with all libraries and compilation included. It requires handlebars 1.3.0 to be installed via node.
