productHasSizes (make it, make sure it konws when null sizes array vs empty sizes array vs array with stuff in it vs array with one size)
sort productsizes from lowest price first
ProductSizes, SizePrice, SizeName (make sure they there in right place)
check html/how looks on big and small
change to use simplecart add method, or some hack with html so that the default simplecart thing is fine - whatever works
test if works
how do we show if sizes but only one size?
